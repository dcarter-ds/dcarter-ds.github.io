![](aqi_gif.gif)

This algorithm was built for a small business for the purposes of finding low air quality zip codes in the US for targeted advertising. The algorithm scrapes the airnow.gov website, maps low air quality locations to their corresponding zip codes and returns the zip codes, state, city and AQI values in a csv file.
